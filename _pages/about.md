Welcome! 

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Agricultural, Food and Resource Economics at Michigan State University. I conduct applied economic research at the intersection of environment, agriculture, and political economy. My [**job market paper**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/fxo2asmb64x1tt2564z0n/JMP-Judhajit-Chakraborty.pdf?rlkey=yx644seoq8iouwfrbw7kiydbl&dl=0) studies the effect of covariate shock- like excess rainfall on perceived relative deprivation.

Here is my other [**research**](https://judhajitc.github.io/research/) and [**teaching**](https://judhajitc.github.io/teaching/) experience.

I am on the 2023-2024 job market and available for interviews.
