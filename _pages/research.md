**Clouds of Comparison: Exploring the Impact of Covariate Shocks on Perceived Relative Deprivation and the Role of Social Policies in Peru**. 2023.
<br/><small>[Draft Coming Soon]</small><br>
<small>
Perceptions of relative deprivation affects a range of outcomes like preference for redistribution, political
discontent and attitudes and trust outcomes. I ask whether covariate shocks in the form of positive rainfall
shocks can change perceptions of relative deprivation? Using a household level panel data and within
household variation in exposure to extreme rainfall shocks, this paper provides novel empirical evidence
on covariate shocks and perceived relative deprivation, in the context of a developing country- Peru. I find
that an exposure to extreme rainfall shocks increases the likelihood of perceiving own standard of living
to be worse off relative to the other households in the locality or community, conditional on household,
month of interview and year fixed effects and household level controls. This is most likely explained
by the differential effect of weather shocks across objective outcomes which translates into an increase
in relative deprivation, as well as, misperceptions about the losses of other households within a locality.
Social protection programs or redistributory policies like the direct cash transfer program- the Peruvian
Juntos, and in-kind food assistance programs play an important role in attenuating the effect of rainfall
shocks on perceived relative deprivation. Results are robust to a range of harmful thresholds of rainfall
shocks, other alternate measures of shock, controlling for household specific idiosyncratic shocks and on
a large cross-sectional data with exploiting both within-conglomerate and within-district variations. Key
findings from this study could generate interest in identifying changes in perceived relative deprivation as
an alternate channel to determining important socio-political outcomes, alongside changes in levels of income.

This paper describes and uses a novel data set on patent applications from India between 2000 and 2016 to understand the spatial pattern of innovation in India and its evolution over time. Identification of such patterns of innovation over time is important as it helps us understand what motivates certain areas to be more innovative than others. Documentation of such patterns was absent to date as the addresses of patentees were not granular. We alleviate this by creating patent-level data using Intellectual Property India's public search tool that helps us add information over traditional data sources. We find that the concentration of patenting has decreased over time, with patents emerging from newer geographies. We also find that the inventors have a lower geographical concentration than patent assignees. The diffusion of innovation depends on geographical closeness to innovative regions and the absorbent capacity of the newly innovating region.

**Is there a home bias in the time taken to grant patents in India?**. 2023.

This paper studies the time taken to grant patent applications in India for foreign and domestic applicants. Home bias in major patent-granting countries is well documented in the literature. Differential treatment of patents by nationality violates Article 3 and 4 of the TRIPS agreement and introduce invisible barriers to the market for protecting intellectual property. India has increasingly become an attractive destination to protect IP in recent years, but no systematic study of the functioning of the patent office in India exists. We supplement existing datasets with novel patent-level information to study two measures of bias --- duration, and rate of the grant of patents among domestic and foreign applicants. We do not find home bias through either of the measures at the Indian office. India does honor the TRIPS agreement's national treatment principle, unlike other major patent offices.
