**Clouds of Comparison: Exploring the Impact of Covariate Shocks and the Role of Social Programs on Perceived Relative Deprivation in Peru**. 2023.
<br/><small>[Draft Coming Soon]</small><br>
<small>
Perceptions of relative deprivation affect a range of economic and behavioral outcomes, such as support for redistribution, political attitudes, hostility, and risky behavior. In this paper, I test whether \textit{covariate shocks} can change perceptions of relative deprivation in a developing country context using \textit{observational data}. Using household-level longitudinal data for Peru, I provide novel evidence showing that exposure to excess rainfall shocks increases the likelihood that households perceive their standard of living to be worse off relative to the other households in the locality. Two fundamental mechanisms could explain this- firstly, the differential effect of excess rainfall shocks across objective outcomes suggests a widening economic gap reflected in standard relative deprivation measures, and secondly, misperceptions about the losses of other households within a locality could explain the increase in perceived relative deprivation. The impact is particularly larger for historically underprivileged and less developed communities. I show that social protection programs, such as conditional cash transfers and in-kind food assistance programs, can attenuate the effect of rainfall shocks on perceived relative deprivation. Finally, I show an association between perceived relative deprivation and political beliefs related to the functioning of democracy and support for authoritarian regimes in Peru.

## Working Papers
**When the Temperature Drops, Perceptions Worsen: Effects of Extreme Cold on Perceptions of Government and Civic Participation in the Peruvian Highlands**. 2023. (with Leah Lakdawala and Eduardo Nakasone)
<br/><small>[Draft](https://judhajitc.github.io/files/FrostAndDemocracy.pdf)</small><br>
<small>
Perceptions of government and political institutions can have important effects on a wide range of outcomes, such as compliance with laws and demand for public goods. We examine how extreme weather affects individuals' belief of how well democracy functions in Peru.  We construct a unique dataset containing spatially and temporally specific cold temperature shocks and find that extreme cold reduces positive perceptions of democracy.  This translates into reductions in civic engagement in formal democratic institutions (as measured by participation in national elections) but increased involvement in local associations. We provide evidence that these effects work through several mechanisms: decreased income, assets, and expenditure as well as increased incidence of illness and some types of crime.  Finally, we find that the negative effects of extreme cold are mitigated by government provision of goods and services, namely, social programs, public hospitals, and police resources.

**Frosty Climate, Icy Relationships: Frosts and Intimate Partner Violence in Rural Peru**. 2023. (with Katie Bollman, Leah Lakdawala and Eduardo Nakasone) 
<br/><small>[Draft](https://judhajitc.github.io/files/Frosts_and_IPV.pdf)</small><br>
<small>
Violence against women — in particular, Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) — is a major health concern for
women across the world. In this paper, we study the impact of frosts (temperatures below 0°C / 32°F) on IPV
among Peruvian women. Using a dataset that matches women to weather exposure, we find that overall, frost
shocks increase IPV: 10 degree hours below -9°C increases the probability of experiencing domestic violence
by 0.5 percentage points. These effects are larger for more extreme temperature thresholds. We provide
evidence that frosts impact IPV through two main channels. First, extreme cold yields adverse consequences
for income, which in turn impacts IPV. Second, extreme cold limits the mobility of individuals, potentially
increasing exposure of women to violent partners. To our knowledge, we are the first to measure relative
significance of these two channels by utilizing variation in frost timing to distinguish shocks that affect IPV
through changes in income from those that act through time spent indoors. We find that the effect of frosts
on IPV is mostly driven by frosts that occur during the growing season, when 10 degree hours below -9°C
increase the probability of experiencing IPV by 1.5 percentage points. In contrast, we find that non-growing
season frosts have no statistically significant effects on IPV.

**Impact of COVID mortality on voting behavior: Evidence from Peru**. 2023. (with Leah Lakdawala and Eduardo Nakasone)
<br/><small>[Draft Coming Soon]</small><br>
<small>
How did the COVID-19 pandemic lead to changes in voting behavior? Are these changes been guided by
drop in confidence or trust in political institutions? Using within district variation in COVID-19 incidence,
this paper provides empirical evidence to these questions for a developing country context, Peru. Studying the
2021 Presidential elections in Peru, we find that- conditional on district and election-year fixed effects and a
set of potentially confounding variables-- districts with a higher incidence of COVID-19 before the elections,
shifted their votes towards left leaning parties. This effect is largest for incidence of COVID-19 three months
and 4-6 months before the election. This result can most likely be explained by examining changes in voter
turnout, and confidence or trust in political institutions.
