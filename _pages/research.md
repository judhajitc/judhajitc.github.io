<small>
Perceptions of relative deprivation or feelings of relative poverty affect a range of economic and behavioral outcomes, such as support for redistribution, political attitudes, hostility, and risky behavior. In this paper, I test whether *covariate shocks*-like excess rainfall shocks can change perceptions of relative deprivation in a developing country context. Using household-level longitudinal data for Peru, I provide novel evidence showing that exposure to excess
rainfall shocks increases the likelihood that households perceive their standard of living to be worse off relative to the other households in the locality. Two fundamental mechanisms could explain this- firstly, the differential effect of excess rainfall shocks across objective outcomes suggests a widening economic gap reflected in standard relative deprivation measures, and secondly, misperceptions about the losses of other households within a locality could explain the increase in perceived relative deprivation. The impact is particularly larger for historically underprivileged and less developed communities, possibly due to limited options of consumption smoothing. I show that social protection programs, such as conditional cash transfers and in-kind food assistance programs, can attenuate the effect of rainfall shocks on perceived relative deprivation. Finally, I show an association between perceived relative deprivation and political beliefs related to the functioning of democracy and support for authoritarian regimes in Peru.

**When the Temperature Drops, Perceptions Worsen: Effects of Extreme Cold on Perceptions of Government and Civic Participation in the Peruvian Highlands**. 2023. (with Leah Lakdawala and Eduardo Nakasone)
<br/><small>[Draft](https://judhajitc.github.io/files/FrostAndDemocracy.pdf)</small><br>
<small>
We examine how extreme weather affects individuals’ perceptions of government and political institutions in Peru. We match granular data on cold weather shocks to individuals using variation in interview date and location and find that extreme cold worsens perceptions of democracy. Further, extreme cold reduces civic engagement in formal democratic institutions
(participation in national elections) but increases participation in local neighborhood associations. We provide evidence that these effects work through several mechanisms: economic losses, increased incidence of illness, and higher crimes. Finally, we find that greater coverage of government-provided goods and services can attenuate the adverse effects of extreme cold.

**Frosty Climate, Icy Relationships: Frosts and Intimate Partner Violence in Rural Peru**. 2023. (with Katie Bollman, Leah Lakdawala and Eduardo Nakasone) 
<br/><small>[Draft](https://judhajitc.github.io/files/Frosts_and_IPV.pdf)</small><br>
<small>
Violence against women — in particular, Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) — is a health concern for women across the world. We study the impact of extreme cold on IPV among Peruvian women. Using a dataset that matches women to weather exposure, we find that overall, frost shocks increase IPV: 10 degree hours below -9°C increases the probability of experiencing domestic violence by 0.5 pp. These effects are larger for more extreme temperature thresholds. We provide evidence that frosts impact IPV through two main channels. First, extreme cold yields adverse consequences for income, which in turn affects IPV. Second, extreme cold limits time spent outside of the household, potentially increasing exposure of women to violent partners. To our knowledge, we are the first to measure relative significance of these two channels by using variation in frost timing to distinguish shocks that affect IPV through changes in income from those that act through time spent indoors. We find that the effect of frosts on IPV is mostly driven by frosts that occur during the growing season, when 10 degree hours below -9°C increases the probability of experiencing IPV by 1.5 percentage points. In contrast, we find that non-growing season frosts have no statistically significant effects on IPV.

**Impact of COVID mortality on voting behavior: Evidence from Peru**. 2023. (with Leah Lakdawala and Eduardo Nakasone)
<br/><small>[Draft Coming Soon]</small><br>
<small>
How did the COVID-19 pandemic lead to changes in voting behavior? Are these changes been guided by
drop in confidence or trust in political institutions? Using within district variation in COVID-19 incidence,
this paper provides empirical evidence to these questions for a developing country context, Peru. Studying the
2021 Presidential elections in Peru, we find that- conditional on district and election-year fixed effects and a
set of potentially confounding variables-- districts with a higher incidence of COVID-19 before the elections,
shifted their votes towards left leaning parties. This effect is largest for incidence of COVID-19 three months
and 4-6 months before the election. This result can most likely be explained by examining changes in voter
turnout, and confidence or trust in political institutions.
