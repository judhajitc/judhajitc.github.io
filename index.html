                <p>Perceptions of relative deprivation affect a range of economic and behavioral outcomes, such
as support for redistribution, political attitudes, and risky behavior. There is scarce evidence
regarding how covariate shocks that affect entire communities shape such perceptions. Using
nationally representative panel data from Peru, and exploiting within-household variation
in exposure to excess rainfall shocks (a covariate shock), I examine how such shocks shape
households‚Äô perceptions of standard of living relative to others in their locality ‚Äì a measure of
perceived relative deprivation. I find that excess rainfall shocks increase households‚Äô perception
of relative deprivation on average, as well as across both poor and non-poor households. The
increase in perceived relative deprivation among poor households can be partially explained by
the disproportionate economic losses that they experience following these shocks. However,
this is not true for non-poor households who suffer no significant economic losses. Finally,
households also systematically misperceive and underestimate neighbors‚Äô welfare losses. This
is a more salient explanation for the increased perceived relative deprivation among non-poor
households following a shock. Suggestive evidence indicates participation in local neighborhood
associations, which provide access to heterogeneous networks, can weaken such misperceptions.
Additionally, access to social protection programs, such as conditional cash transfers and in-kind
food assistance, attenuates the effect of these shocks on perceived relative deprivation. The
paper informs our understanding of why demand for redistribution may remain muted during
episodes of rising inequality and poverty, and reveal the potential limitations of communitybased poverty targeting methods during crisis periods.</p>

                <p>Violence against women ‚Äî in particular, Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) ‚Äî is a health
concern for women across the world. We study the effect of cold exposure on IPV among
Peruvian women. Using a dataset that matches women to weather exposure, we find that
cold shocks increase IPV: 10 degree hours below -9¬∞C increases the probability of experiencing
domestic violence by 0.5 percentage points. These effects are larger for more extreme temperature
thresholds. We then provide evidence that cold influences IPV through two main channels. First,
extreme cold reduces income. Second, extreme cold limits time spent outside of the household,
potentially increasing exposure of women to violent partners. To our knowledge, we are the
first to measure relative significance of these two channels by using variation in cold timing
to distinguish shocks that affect IPV through changes in income from those that act through
time spent indoors. We find that the effect of cold on IPV is mostly driven by low temperatures
that occur during the agricultural growing season, when income is most affected; 10 degree
hours below -9¬∞C during the growing season increases the probability of experiencing IPV by
1.6 percentage points. In contrast, we find that cold exposure outside of the growing season has
no statistically significant effect on IPV.
